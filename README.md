## Objective
My journey in self-learning about cybersecurity has led me to develop a passion for IT, and I am now eager to transition into this field. I am fortunate enough to be currently hired as a network engineer. Moving into the future, I aspire to develop my career into IT security or into the clouds :)

My main objective for this landing page is to showcase my networking, cybersecurity and other IT home lab projects.
